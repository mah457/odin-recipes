    <p>Whether you’ve just had a baby, you work long hours, or you’re juggling multiple kids’ sports schedules, I’ve got a burrito recipe that will bring the joy back to your family’s dinner table. Best of all, these store beautifully in the freezer!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>

        <li>¾ cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice (I like to use Uncle Ben's microwaveable Ready Rice for a quick option)</li>
        <li>6 large (10-inch) flour tortillas (I like to use Mission brand "burrito size" tortillas)</li>
