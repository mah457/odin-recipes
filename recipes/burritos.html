    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We all have those busy weeks when we don’t have the time or the energy to cook dinner. Simple prep-ahead options are the KEY to making mealtime manageable!</p>
    <p>Whether you’ve just had a baby, you work long hours, or you’re juggling multiple kids’ sports schedules, I’ve got a burrito recipe that will bring the joy back to your family’s dinner table. Best of all, these store beautifully in the freezer!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups refried beans (or 1 ½ cups drained and rinsed black beans)</li>
        <li>¾ cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice (I like to use Uncle Ben's microwaveable Ready Rice for a quick option)</li>
        <li>6 large (10-inch) flour tortillas (I like to use Mission brand "burrito size" tortillas)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions. </li>
        <li>To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese. </li>
        <li>Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they’re still cold, it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.</li>
    </ol>
