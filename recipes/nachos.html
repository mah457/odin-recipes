        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F(200°C).</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to a skillet over medium heat and cook for about 5 minutes, using a spatula to break up the meat as it cooks. Drain any fat. Then add the taco seasoning and cook for 5 minutes more, until browned and slightly crispy.</li>
